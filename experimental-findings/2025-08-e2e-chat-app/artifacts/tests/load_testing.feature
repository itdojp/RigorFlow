Feature: Load Testing and Performance
  As a system administrator

    When each user sends 10 messages per minute
    Then the system should handle 5000 messages per minute

    Given 2000 WebSocket connections are established
    When the connections remain idle for 10 minutes
    Then all connections should remain active
    And heartbeat messages should be exchanged
    And reconnection rate should be below 1%
    And memory consumption should not grow
    And connection pool should be efficiently managed

  Scenario: Peak Load Handling
    Given the system is running at normal load
    When traffic suddenly increases by 500%
    Then the system should scale appropriately
    And new requests should be queued if needed
    And existing connections should not be affected
    And auto-scaling should trigger within 2 minutes
    And system should stabilize within 5 minutes

  Scenario: File Upload Under Load
    Given 100 users are uploading files simultaneously
    When each uploads a 10MB file
    Then all uploads should complete successfully
    And upload time should be under 30 seconds
    And storage system should not bottleneck
    And other operations should remain responsive
    And file integrity should be maintained

  Scenario: Database Connection Pool Test
    Given database pool size is set to 100
    When 200 concurrent requests are made
    Then connections should be efficiently pooled
    And wait time for connection should be minimal
    And no connection timeout errors should occur
    And pool metrics should show healthy utilization
    And queries should execute within SLA

  Scenario: Memory Leak Detection
    Given the application is under constant load
    When it runs for 24 hours continuously
    Then memory usage should remain within bounds
    And garbage collection should work effectively
    And no memory leaks should be detected
    And performance should not degrade over time
    And all resources should be properly released

  Scenario: CPU Intensive Operations
    Given 50 users are using encryption features
    When they send encrypted messages simultaneously
    Then CPU usage should be distributed across cores
    And encryption should complete within 100ms
    And other operations should not be blocked
    And thread pool should be efficiently utilized
    And response times should remain acceptable

  Scenario: Network Bandwidth Test
    Given 100 users are in video calls
    When they stream simultaneously
    Then bandwidth should be efficiently utilized
    And quality should adapt to available bandwidth
    And packet loss should be below 1%
    And jitter should be below 30ms
    And streams should not interfere with each other

  Scenario: Cache Performance Test
    Given Redis cache is configured
    When 10000 cache operations per second occur
    Then cache hit ratio should be above 90%
    And cache response time should be under 5ms
    And cache eviction should work properly
    And memory usage should be optimal
    And cache consistency should be maintained

  Scenario: Notification Delivery Under Load
    Given 5000 users have push notifications enabled
    When a broadcast notification is sent
    Then all devices should receive it within 10 seconds
    And notification service should not crash
    And delivery rate should be above 99%
    And retry mechanism should handle failures
    And duplicate notifications should not occur

  Scenario: Search Performance Test
    Given 1 million messages in the database
    When 100 users search simultaneously
    Then search results should return within 2 seconds
    And search index should be efficiently used
    And relevance ranking should work correctly
    And pagination should work smoothly
    And database should not lock

  Scenario: Authentication Load Test
    Given 1000 users attempt to login
    When they authenticate within 1 minute
    Then all logins should be processed
    And JWT generation should be fast
    And session creation should not bottleneck
    And rate limiting should prevent abuse
    And failed attempts should be logged

  Scenario: Graceful Degradation Test
    Given the system is at maximum capacity
    When additional load is applied
    Then non-critical features should be disabled
    And core functionality should remain available
    And users should receive appropriate messages
    And system should not crash
    And recovery should be automatic when load reduces

  Scenario: Geographic Distribution Test
    Given users from 5 different regions
    When they interact across regions
    Then latency should be acceptable for each region
    And CDN should serve static content efficiently
    And data consistency should be maintained
    And regional failover should work
    And performance should meet regional SLAs

  Scenario: API Rate Limiting Test

    And legitimate traffic should not be affected
    And rate limit counters should be accurate
